# Tutorial

In Two Hand, all expressions have two hands.

Let's define something:

```
{main [x x]}
```

The left hand of a definition is a name and the right hand is an
expression.

Here the expression is a function `[x x]`. The left hand is a
parameter and the right hand is an expression. This function just
takes something and returns it.

The interpreter will print `[x x]`. This is because a function
evaluates to itself.

Let's extract that function:

```
{id [x x]}

{main (id id)}
```

To call our new `id` function, we use application `(id id)`. Both
hands of an application are expressions.

The interpreter prints `[x x]`.

And that's all.

> But what about multiple arguments?

```
{const [x [y x]]}

{main ((const [a a]) [b b])}
```

Result: `[a a]`

> But how do I write Hello World?

```
{main [hello [world [! !]]]}
```

Result: `[hello [world [! !]]]`

> But what about `if`?

```
{true [x [y x]]}

{false [x [y y]]}

{not [x ((x false) true)]}

{if [bool [a [b ((bool a) b)]]]}

{a [a a]}

{b [b b]}

{main (((if (not true)) a) b)}
```

Result: `[b b]`
